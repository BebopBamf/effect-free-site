This project can also be attributed to my time at macquarie. It is the result of
my experiences with competative programming. It was a quick reference for C++
memory safety and bugs for people wanting to write code for competitive
programming purposes.

# Description

To me competitive programming was kind of a shock to the system. Where
problem solving and speed was the main focus. Things like readability and safety
were kind of tossed to the side. The majority of macquarie uni having had no
experience with memory safety and C++ in general often created memory leaks when
dealing with dynamic arrays.

While I was doing competitive programming I discovered it wasn't for me. I had
always struggled with thinking of things on the spot and was more attuned to
careful planning and forethought.

I decided that I would write a quick memory safety reference for people using
rust mdbook. Being primarily a rust developer there is long standing plans to
update the reference to go beyond the basics and talk about efficiency and move
semantics, as well as possibly mentioning concurrency.
