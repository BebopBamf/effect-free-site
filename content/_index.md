Welcome to my personal website. This website is really the start of the evangelisation of functional
programming. Here I plan on indoctrinating everyone into functional programming and functional programmming
practices (maybe joking, maybe not...). Here I plan on posting updates on projects I am working on and
some general blog stuff. Tips for linux users and developers will be included and my personal development
progress as a programmer might be mentioned. A few demo projects might also appear now and then.
