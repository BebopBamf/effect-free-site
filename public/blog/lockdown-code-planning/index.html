            <p>In highschool I had a assignment that nearly killed me. This assignment was
called the classroom manager. I never finished it and now with all the time that
lockdown has awarded us, I feel like it is finally time to revisit it. In my
first lockdown session I will entirely focus on my own personal process of
planning for development and writing documentation.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h1 id="intro-to-the-classroom-manager">Intro to the classroom manager</h1>
<p>The problem with the classroom manager is it is deceptively simple, but having
tried it and not having finished it, I know it is actually quite a task. The
actual assignment had a few requirements that I will go through first before I
attempt to tackle the actual planning.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Has to store persistant data (preferably with a database).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has to contain a graphical element (no cli applications).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has to contain testing (unit testing, and integration testing if deployed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has to be documented and planned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has to contain a single addition feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code has to be clean (very small main function, split into different
packages).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think for me the real killer was the requirement to have persistant data
storage and a graphical element. At the time the reason I didn't finish was the
requirement to have an additional feature. It mean't that you would over
compensate and try and plan all these amazing things, only a small fraction of
which was actually reasonably doable. The actual spec is already hard enough to
implement with no additional features.</p>
<p>Let's go through the spec now, it will make most people chuckle, but on further
thought it will make people cry.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have class lists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recording of marks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recording of timetables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behaviour notes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is all there is, your imagination is your enemy and friend. As such there
was no requirement for the application to be CRUD. While the spec only requires
that timetables and marks be CRUD, and everything else can be read only, I
thought it would be a good idea to have the entire application be crud on the
api atleast.</p>
<h2 id="my-previous-interpretation-from-highschool">My previous interpretation from highschool</h2>
<p>I will admit in highschool I bit off far more then I could chew. I knew from the
start the classroom manager was a tool for teachers, but my extra features were
that it could also be for students and that I would have some authentication
and authorization flow. Having been my first ever introduction to auth flows I
thought it would be a good idea to implement it all by myself. I interpreted
class lists as a crud operation where admins could create and delete, view and
update classes. Classes had students, and teachers. Teachers could view all
classes and there own. Students could only view the classes that they were
assigned to. I had viewed recording of marks as having assessments and tracking
them, with different assessment types, and different assessments had marks
allocated to each student. Which was a reasonable interpretation. Recording of
timetables was a big gotcha, I had interpreted as recording of a roll, and
marking each student as present, absent or not. I had also interpreted it as
having teachers have a set schedule that they could view there classes and
times. This is not reasonable for many reasons and it is super hard to implement
depending on how you represent your data. Our last requirement behaviour notes
is super easy, you record the behaviour of each student in a class. For this
no timestamp is required and you could interpret it as just a single behaviour
note per class. I decided which I still standby, just to have a behaviour note
for a student and a class.</p>
<h3 id="some-considerations-i-did-not-make">Some considerations I did not make</h3>
<p>Having the classroom manager extend to students was the dumbest idea ever, it
increased the workload exponentially. Writing your own auth implementation was
even more so dumb, 90% of the time I spent on the classroom manager was figuring
out how to implement the proper auth flow.</p>
<p>A massive pitfall was also I never considered much what the end result would
look like, back then I had done some web development with python django, and in
retro spect I should have just used python django. Having wanted to try
something different I wanted to go a different route, first thinking of spring
boot and java, but I had no clue what a rest api was. Now having had experience
I now know what the application 'could' look like in production from just pure
imagination.</p>
<p>I think probably my biggest downfall in lack of foresight which came from lack
of experience was dealing with internationalization. I never thought about how
I would deal with dates and times. When initally planning the database for the
project I had done something stupid by making the tables be naive timestamps. I
had no plan for converting to a format that would show consistant times no
matter where you are in the world. A massive pitfall of this approach wasn't
just internationalization which I didn't know about, but how to deal with things
like timetables where teachers would have subjects in regular intervals of time.
Trying to figure this out was one of the reasons my timetable never worked.</p>
<h2 id="a-more-sane-interpretation">A more sane interpretation</h2>
<p>A more sane interpretation is still pretty similar. I made the application be
for teachers use only, easily improved upon in the future if students need
access to the application. I kept the requirement for authentication because by
itself that is reasonable, but this time outsourcing it to a 3rd party provider
(auth0). For class lists to me that means you have crud operations for managing
a teachers class. Admin roles can create and delete classes. Teachers can update
their own classes, and view all classes. Kept recording of marks exactly the
same. For timetables I do nothing, I interpret it as part of the crud operation
for classes, and just the ability to view a class timetable for a teacher. The
ability to update a class for a teacher gives them the ability to 'manage their
timetable'. For behaviour notes I also kept the interpretation the same.</p>
<h1 id="bottom-up-design-and-the-agile-approach">Bottom up design and the agile approach</h1>
<p>Having defined and fleshed out the end users requirements, we now start thinking
about agile approaches to development. This looks like</p>
<p>technical requirements -&gt; development -&gt; testing -&gt; deploy -&gt; repeat</p>
<p>We can use devops to automate a lot of this process including creating technical
requirements.</p>
<p>Our first step in creating our application is thinking about how
we want to plan our application. Applying this second derivative thinking where
you think about how you change your application over time. It allows us to stay
ahead of the curve so later on we won't have to rewrite our model for developing
features and things.</p>
<p>What this looks like is planning ahead what our tool stack looks like, thinking
about things that shouldn't change in the future, thinking about what we cannot
change and what we can change.</p>
<h2 id="planning-the-toolstack">Planning the toolstack</h2>
<p>Often this includes experience and design considerations. First of all I think
about what offers me the ease of use to accomplish my goal, compared to giving
me the greatest flexibility to improve upon in the future. Think back to
companies choosing a bad framework or library, writing code that isn't
maintainable and the cost of having to rewrite from scratch.</p>
<p>My first consideration was documentation. When I first wrote the classroom
manager I used microsoft word (lol). I won't go into why this sucks. Having
learn't my lesson I will use plain images and https://dbdiagram.io for
my database schemas. I also will use the react component for redoc to document
the api. For the front end nothing beats plain old pen and paper (I won't even
though because I have an ipad and apple pencil).</p>
<p>Writing authorization is pretty simple, just use auth0 and their libraries.</p>
<p>Back when I first wrote the class manager I used golang and graphql. GraphQL was
a good choice but now I choose to ditch it because while it will give me more
flexibility in the future, my experience and ease of writing rest apis outweighs
the cost. GraphQL was also made to be easily added to legacy rest api's so it is
still an option for the future. Golang has to go, it sucks, I decided to build
my application using F# and Giraffe, a functional wrapper around the native
dotnet aspnet web libraries.</p>
<p>The frontend was a simple choice, typescript, react, redux, react-router, and
functional reactive programming. Why? because that is what I used when I first
planned the site originally. Of course I transitioned to graphql so redux became
apollo, but in the end it is pretty much the same thing. When I wrote the
application I was a different man though. I tried object oriented and plain
javascript but it caused so much headaches, so I ended up using typescript and
react-hooks which was beta at the time. Now I would go for a much more elm like
approach to front end software development. I also forgot to mention I will use
bootstrap, I originally used material react, which I thought looked super ugly.
bootstrap also looks ugly but it is just a boiler plate for responsiveness,
extending bootstrap is the goal compared to material design themes where what
you get is what you're stuck with.</p>
<p>Planning how we write our documentation is important because as we figure out
problems and pitfalls, redefining the requirements will become essential. This
is the second derivative thinking we were talking about before (thinking about
how our application will change over time).</p>
<h2 id="bottom-up-starting-with-the-pen-and-paper">Bottom up - Starting with the pen and paper</h2>
<p>Our first goal is to create a database, then the server side and then finally
the client side in a bottom up approach. Defining what the database looks like
makes it so easy to figure out what the api and the front end will look like.</p>
<p>On the other hand to develop the database, we need to figure out what it needs
to accomplish, so we start on an even lower level then the database, where we
start by planning on pen and paper.</p>
<p>For me this typically looks like writing down what we need to accomplish or the
4 points of the application. Figuring out possible routes and data models and
maybe a few sketches of the client.</p>
<p>For the classroom manager I didn't even bother with the data models, I just went
straight to the routes, I had already done the project before and new roughly
what the data models would look like, but not having done a rest api, needed to
think about routes. Pen and paper is just a rough sketch of ideas, it is not a
concrete part of the agile process. It is kind of like a hidden secret to great
planning. Something to get your ideas down quickly as they come before they
disappear.</p>

<p><img src="./PAGE_TWO.JPEG" alt="Second Planning Page" title="Second Planning Page" /></p>
<p><img src="./PAGE_THREE.JPEG" alt="Third Planning Page" title="Third Planning Page" /></p>
<p>A quick thing to note is how to write technical requirements. Technical
requirements for me personally are not a broad set of things that your
application may do. They aren't written in words. Technical requirements are the
api docs (redoc, swagger) or the database ER diagram. Technical requirements are
handrawn or wireframe mockups of what the application will look like in
production. In the original application one task we had to do was to create
documentation for our application, after a few years, I disagree with the
documentation I wrote, I shouldn't have pseudo code in the documentation and
the requirements should have been a more concrete thing like endpoints we had to
implement and a database ER diagram we had to make.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-up-planning-the-database">Bottom up - Planning the database</h2>
<p>This is relatively simple, in university they made it so complicated and hard
but all you have to do is log onto dbdiagram.io, and enter a bit of code where
you loosely define relationships for your entities. You could also do a more
graphical approach with other software if you prefer but this is definately my
most preferred method of database planning.</p>
