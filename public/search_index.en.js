This assignment was\ncalled the classroom manager. I never finished it and now with all the time that\nlockdown has awarded us, I feel like it is finally time to revisit it. In my\nfirst lockdown session I will entirely focus on my own personal process of\nplanning for development and writing documentation.\nIntro to the classroom manager\nThe problem with the classroom manager is it is deceptively simple, but having\ntried it and not having finished it, I know it is actually quite a task. The\nactual assignment had a few requirements that I will go through first before I\nattempt to tackle the actual planning.\n\n\nHas to store persistant data (preferably with a database).\n\n\nHas to contain a graphical element (no cli applications).\n\n\nHas to contain testing (unit testing, and integration testing if deployed).\n\n\nHas to be documented and planned.\n\n\nHas to contain a single addition feature.\n\n\nThe code has to be clean (very small main function, split into different\npackages).\n\n\nI think for me the real killer was the requirement to have persistant data\nstorage and a graphical element. At the time the reason I didn't finish was the\nrequirement to have an additional feature. It mean't that you would over\ncompensate and try and plan all these amazing things, only a small fraction of\nwhich was actually reasonably doable. The actual spec is already hard enough to\nimplement with no additional features.\nLet's go through the spec now, it will make most people chuckle, but on further\nthought it will make people cry.\n\n\nHave class lists\n\n\nRecording of marks\n\n\nRecording of timetables\n\n\nBehaviour notes\n\n\nThat is all there is, your imagination is your enemy and friend. As such there\nwas no requirement for the application to be CRUD. While the spec only requires\nthat timetables and marks be CRUD, and everything else can be read only, I\nthought it would be a good idea to have the entire application be crud on the\napi atleast.\nMy previous interpretation from highschool\nI will admit in highschool I bit off far more then I could chew. I knew from the\nstart the classroom manager was a tool for teachers, but my extra features were\nthat it could also be for students and that I would have some authentication\nand authorization flow. Having been my first ever introduction to auth flows I\nthought it would be a good idea to implement it all by myself. I interpreted\nclass lists as a crud operation where admins could create and delete, view and\nupdate classes. Classes had students, and teachers. Teachers could view all\nclasses and there own. Students could only view the classes that they were\nassigned to. I had viewed recording of marks as having assessments and tracking\nthem, with different assessment types, and different assessments had marks\nallocated to each student. Which was a reasonable interpretation. Recording of\ntimetables was a big gotcha, I had interpreted as recording of a roll, and\nmarking each student as present, absent or not. I had also interpreted it as\nhaving teachers have a set schedule that they could view there classes and\ntimes. This is not reasonable for many reasons and it is super hard to implement\ndepending on how you represent your data. Our last requirement behaviour notes\nis super easy, you record the behaviour of each student in a class. For this\nno timestamp is required and you could interpret it as just a single behaviour\nnote per class. I decided which I still standby, just to have a behaviour note\nfor a student and a class.\nSome considerations I did not make\nHaving the classroom manager extend to students was the dumbest idea ever, it\nincreased the workload exponentially. Writing your own auth implementation was\neven more so dumb, 90% of the time I spent on the classroom manager was figuring\nout how to implement the proper auth flow.\nA massive pitfall was also I never considered much what the end result would\nlook like, back then I had done some web development with python django, and in\nretro spect I should have just used python django. Having wanted to try\nsomething different I wanted to go a different route, first thinking of spring\nboot and java, but I had no clue what a rest api was. Now having had experience\nI now know what the application 'could' look like in production from just pure\nimagination.\nI think probably my biggest downfall in lack of foresight which came from lack\nof experience was dealing with internationalization. I never thought about how\nI would deal with dates and times. When initally planning the database for the\nproject I had done something stupid by making the tables be naive timestamps. I\nhad no plan for converting to a format that would show consistant times no\nmatter where you are in the world. A massive pitfall of this approach wasn't\njust internationalization which I didn't know about, but how to deal with things\nlike timetables where teachers would have subjects in regular intervals of time.\nTrying to figure this out was one of the reasons my timetable never worked.\nA more sane interpretation\nA more sane interpretation is still pretty similar. I made the application be\nfor teachers use only, easily improved upon in the future if students need\naccess to the application. I kept the requirement for authentication because by\nitself that is reasonable, but this time outsourcing it to a 3rd party provider\n(auth0). For class lists to me that means you have crud operations for managing\na teachers class. Admin roles can create and delete classes. Teachers can update\ntheir own classes, and view all classes. Kept recording of marks exactly the\nsame. For timetables I do nothing, I interpret it as part of the crud operation\nfor classes, and just the ability to view a class timetable for a teacher. The\nability to update a class for a teacher gives them the ability to 'manage their\ntimetable'. For behaviour notes I also kept the interpretation the same.\nBottom up design and the agile approach\nHaving defined and fleshed out the end users requirements, we now start thinking\nabout agile approaches to development. This looks like\ntechnical requirements -&gt; development -&gt; testing -&gt; deploy -&gt; repeat\nWe can use devops to automate a lot of this process including creating technical\nrequirements.\nOur first step in creating our application is thinking about how\nwe want to plan our application. Applying this second derivative thinking where\nyou think about how you change your application over time. It allows us to stay\nahead of the curve so later on we won't have to rewrite our model for developing\nfeatures and things.\nWhat this looks like is planning ahead what our tool stack looks like, thinking\nabout things that shouldn't change in the future, thinking about what we cannot\nchange and what we can change.\nPlanning the toolstack\nOften this includes experience and design considerations. First of all I think\nabout what offers me the ease of use to accomplish my goal, compared to giving\nme the greatest flexibility to improve upon in the future. Think back to\ncompanies choosing a bad framework or library, writing code that isn't\nmaintainable and the cost of having to rewrite from scratch.\nMy first consideration was documentation. When I first wrote the classroom\nmanager I used microsoft word (lol). I won't go into why this sucks. Having\nlearn't my lesson I will use plain images and https://dbdiagram.io for\nmy database schemas. I also will use the react component for redoc to document\nthe api. For the front end nothing beats plain old pen and paper (I won't even\nthough because I have an ipad and apple pencil).\nWriting authorization is pretty simple, just use auth0 and their libraries.\nBack when I first wrote the class manager I used golang and graphql. GraphQL was\na good choice but now I choose to ditch it because while it will give me more\nflexibility in the future, my experience and ease of writing rest apis outweighs\nthe cost. GraphQL was also made to be easily added to legacy rest api's so it is\nstill an option for the future. Golang has to go, it sucks, I decided to build\nmy application using F# and Giraffe, a functional wrapper around the native\ndotnet aspnet web libraries.\nThe frontend was a simple choice, typescript, react, redux, react-router, and\nfunctional reactive programming. Why? because that is what I used when I first\nplanned the site originally. Of course I transitioned to graphql so redux became\napollo, but in the end it is pretty much the same thing. When I wrote the\napplication I was a different man though. I tried object oriented and plain\njavascript but it caused so much headaches, so I ended up using typescript and\nreact-hooks which was beta at the time. Now I would go for a much more elm like\napproach to front end software development. I also forgot to mention I will use\nbootstrap, I originally used material react, which I thought looked super ugly.\nbootstrap also looks ugly but it is just a boiler plate for responsiveness,\nextending bootstrap is the goal compared to material design themes where what\nyou get is what you're stuck with.\nPlanning how we write our documentation is important because as we figure out\nproblems and pitfalls, redefining the requirements will become essential. This\nis the second derivative thinking we were talking about before (thinking about\nhow our application will change over time).\nBottom up - Starting with the pen and paper\nOur first goal is to create a database, then the server side and then finally\nthe client side in a bottom up approach. Defining what the database looks like\nmakes it so easy to figure out what the api and the front end will look like.\nOn the other hand to develop the database, we need to figure out what it needs\nto accomplish, so we start on an even lower level then the database, where we\nstart by planning on pen and paper.\nFor me this typically looks like writing down what we need to accomplish or the\n4 points of the application. Figuring out possible routes and data models and\nmaybe a few sketches of the client.\nFor the classroom manager I didn't even bother with the data models, I just went\nstraight to the routes, I had already done the project before and new roughly\nwhat the data models would look like, but not having done a rest api, needed to\nthink about routes. Pen and paper is just a rough sketch of ideas, it is not a\nconcrete part of the agile process. It is kind of like a hidden secret to great\nplanning. Something to get your ideas down quickly as they come before they\ndisappear.\n\n\n\nA quick thing to note is how to write technical requirements. Technical\nrequirements for me personally are not a broad set of things that your\napplication may do. They aren't written in words. Technical requirements are the\napi docs (redoc, swagger) or the database ER diagram. Technical requirements are\nhandrawn or wireframe mockups of what the application will look like in\nproduction. In the original application one task we had to do was to create\ndocumentation for our application, after a few years, I disagree with the\ndocumentation I wrote, I shouldn't have pseudo code in the documentation and\nthe requirements should have been a more concrete thing like endpoints we had to\nimplement and a database ER diagram we had to make.\nBottom up - Planning the database\nThis is relatively simple, in university they made it so complicated and hard\nbut all you have to do is log onto dbdiagram.io, and enter a bit of code where\nyou loosely define relationships for your entities. You could also do a more\ngraphical approach with other software if you prefer but this is definately my\nmost preferred method of database planning.\nTable users as U {\n  id uuid [pk, increment] // auto-increment\n  full_name varchar [not null]\n  email varchar [unique, not null]\n  role role_names [not null]\n}\n\nEnum role_names {\n  admin\n  teacher\n  student\n}\n\nTable school_sessions as SS {\n  id int [pk, increment, unique, not null]\n  name varchar [not null]\n  start_date bigint [unique, not null]\n  end_date bigint [unique, not null]\n}\n\nTable school_holidays as SH {\n  id int [pk, increment, unique, not null]\n  session_id int [not null, ref: &gt; SS.id]\n  name varchar [not null]\n  description varchar [not null]\n  start_date bigint [not null]\n  end_date bigint [not null]\n}\n\nTable subjects as S {\n  id int [pk, increment, unique, not null]\n  code varchar [unique, not null]\n  name varchar [unique, not null]\n  description text [not null]\n}\n\nTable subject_periods as SP {\n  id int [pk, increment, unique, not null]\n  subject_id int [not null, ref: &gt; S.id]\n  coordinator_id uuid [not null, ref: &gt; U.id]\n  session_id int [not null, ref: &gt; SS.id]\n}\n\nTable class_rooms as CR {\n  name varchar [pk, unique, not null]\n  building varchar [not null, default: \"Main Campus\"]\n  location varchar [unique, not null]\n}\n\nTable classes as C {\n  code varchar [pk, unique, not null]\n  room varchar [not null, ref: &gt; CR.name]\n  subject_period_id int [not null, ref: &gt; SP.id]\n  teacher_id uuid [not null, ref: &gt; U.id]\n  period_start int [not null]\n  period_end int [not null]\n}\n\nTable assessments as A {\n  id int [pk, increment, unique, not null]\n  subject_period_id int [not null, ref: &gt; SP.id]\n  type assessment_types [not null]\n  name varchar [not null]\n  start_timestamp bigint [not null]\n  end_timestamp bigint [not null]\n  weight int [not null]\n  total_marks int [not null]\n}\n\nEnum assessment_types {\n  assignment\n  quiz\n  exam\n}\n\nTable marks as M {\n  assessment_id int [not null, ref: &gt; A.id]\n  marker_id uuid [not null, ref: &gt; U.id]\n  student_id uuid [not null, ref: &gt; U.id]\n  mark int [not null]\n  feedback text [not null]\n  Indexes {\n    (assessment_id, student_id) [pk]\n  }\n}\n\nTable behaviour_notes as BN {\n  class_id int [not null, ref: &gt; C.code]\n  student_id uuid [not null, ref: &gt; U.id]\n  behaviour_note text [not null]\n  created_at bigint [not null]\n  Indexes {\n    (class_id, student_id) [pk]\n  }\n}\n\nRef: \"assessments\".\"id\" &lt; \"assessments\".\"subject_period_id\"\n\nThe output would look something like this:\n\nI usually put this in a ./docs/db subdirectory of my project.\nThat's it for lockdown coding part 1. Thanks.\n","id":"https://www.effectfree.dev/blog/lockdown-code-planning/","title":"Lockdown Code Part 1: Planning a classroom manager"},"https://www.effectfree.dev/blog/microsoft-fanboy/":{"body":"I have tried developing a web api in F#, progress is going great but it is very janky and I have mixed feelings.\nF# for web development and my first 'enterprise' language\nSo for those who don't know me I would consider myself an intermediate or experienced programmer. Having used languages such as Haskell, Java, C#,\nPython, C++, GoLang and others. I have made many restful api's but never in languages that people would consider 'Enterprise'. I mainly use Rust\nand Actix web because I always found it was relatively easy to use while being blazing fast, super safe and also fun. Except as an emerging language\nI found that some of it's integration with things like Docker had a lot to be desired. Then you would always end up fighting a type checker or something\nand it would be more of a frustrating experience to develop with. Also Rust seems so little known outside of major 'Rustacians' that it doesn't seem like\na good selling point when you tell people, 'Oh yeah, I mainly write in rust'. So for this year I really wanted to learn some more 'enterprise' and well known\nlanguages. I had heard lots and lots of good things about the dotnet toolstack and F# and as someone who also considers themselves a more functional programmer\nI really really wanted to try it. Among the other enterprise level web programming languages, I also plan on trying elixir, GoLang and Clojure. One of my\nformitive experiences in programming was developing an API in golang, but this was long before I understood memory safety, the difference between the stack \nand the heap, and the general structure of an API so my API was a mess and put me off golang for quite a while. F# was definately my first choice in trying\na more common language because it is one of the few languages along with Clojure that I would consider 'enterprise', also I learn't to program in C# and ever \nsince moving to Linux as my main OS had been missing the dotnet toolstack. Now with dotnet core 5 and eagerness I was ready to re-enter my roots as a dotnet\ndeveloper and it was even more fun then I had thought.\nThe good\nF# as a language is one of my favourite languages to use so far, it is a nice bridge between being as functional as Haskell, but not being too restrictive that\nit hampers development speeds. It's entire language structure revolves around monads, and function composition, which are some of my favourite idea's in programming.\nThe tools were a pleasure to work with and all the boilerplate code was autogenerated. This was definately a far cry from Rust which had a lot of boiler plate code\nthat needed to be written before a web server was up and running. It supports async operations which for now I am too afraid to use, and being a functional language\nI am sure there are a plethora of multithreading options. A nice bonus too is having the support of being a 'enterprise' language. Something you feel comfortable\nusing because you know that production code runs using the tool stack. Running on aspnet using Giraffe, F# was so nice to have interoperability with C#. The type\nsystem felt very comfortable and was very fun to play around with.\nPaket the F# package manager\nPaket by itself was super nice to work with, I really enjoyed it. Back when I first started programming, I almost never used package managers, using instead the\nintegrated packages autogenerated by libraries. This all changed in highschool when I started using pip with python. Then going to Cpp, really highlighted how nice\na really easy to use package manager is. Using rust now, for me having a really good package manager, or just the ability to quickly add libraries and swap them out\nis a super important and integral part of my web development experience. It is something I rely on when learning a new language and Paket by itself didn't disappoint.\nThe horror stories\nNow there are a couple of things that I still am not sold on about writing web api's in F#. When I first started I was super old fashioned and would only setup databases\nthe traditional way, instead of containerising. I would avoid Docker at all costs. When I kept hearing about how good Docker was I started using it and I plan on only\nusing Docker for databases from now on for automation purposes. There was a slight snag though when I tried integrating an actix_web api I had written in rust with\nDocker. I use postgres for all my databases and was using a new database driver written in pure rust (sqlx) to connect to postgres. The problem was that using docker-compose\nwould compile the web api before starting the database. Sqlx needed the database to be up and running at compile time in order to perform type checking of data types at \ncompile time. This is a super nice feature but makes containerising a nightmere, and I asked around everywhere and nobody I talked to had ever encountered that problem before\nbecause type checking database types at compile time was such a niche thing for university hobbiests. This pushed me to consider using other languages and extending myself,\nbut since then sqlx has added support for offline database type checking using json files. Now there are database ORM's for dotnet, but when using F# because of it's extensive\ntype system seemed to recommend using F# specific database ORM's instead for added type benefits. These also checked database types at compile time so undergo the same problem\nbut they support offline databases just like rust. It does seem to be alot more work then rust does and the documentation is very vague from what I have read so I am not keen\non that. Now might be a good time to mention all my complaints are going to be database related sadly. There seems to be lots of database libraries for F# but really only\none had support for the database I use Postgres where all the otherones used microsoft databases. I struggled so much to install this database driver, all morning was spent\ntrying to install it. So I installed the database driver using Paket, but the library didn't work, I ended up trying multiple things and breaking the project. That is when\nI found a little snippet of the website saying you needed to link a certain binary to the application, and doing some digging found a file paket.references. I created a new\nproject that was a replica of the older project and added the library name which was SQLProvider to the project paket.references file. This ended up working, but I felt like\nthe documentation could have included more information about this and am still not sure if I had installed it correctly. My second thing that annoyed me was for a rest api\nit wasn't clear if there was an easy way to return the changed values after an insert or an update query. This is standard rest stuff, so it would've been nice to have a clear\nway, I couldn't find any browswing throught the guide. The last thing that probably annoyed me the most about the database library was how it handled errors. Once inserting new\nvalues into the database, you call ctx.SubmitUpdates which is a function that returns a unit type. For the non-functional programmers, a unit type is the equivalent of \na function returning void in C#, Java or Cpp. This to me points to the library using impure functions, I would have liked to see a monad here, or a Result type such as in rust.\nI like it when database libraries return Result, because then you can create a set of Http errors, and map each Result Err into a Http Err, for example if a Product already exists\nand you try creating a product with the same id, then you can map the database error to a http error an error response in your rest api. This doesn't seem possible with F#\nand which for a functional programming language dissapointed me. So maybe I will continue the project in F#, or maybe move to Elixir or back to good old Rust.\n","id":"https://www.effectfree.dev/blog/microsoft-fanboy/","title":"Microsoft Fanboy"},"https://www.effectfree.dev/blog/vulkan-raytracing/":{"body":"Bit of a little update on me and raytracing\nA Raytracing Engine in Vulkan\nMid last year, for no reason at all, I tried adapting the Ray Tracing in One Weekend book to Rust, and created my 'first' raytracing engine.\nThis was one of the most fun projects I have ever taken up and doing research and learning was an essential part of it. It taught me a lot\nabout the inner workings of concurrent programming, and also taught me a lot about graphics and maths. Then early this year I discovered a new\nlibrary. This library was called Vulkano, it is a simple rust binding to vulkan, but anyone who has ever tried to use vulkan before would also\nknow about the annoyingly large amount of boilerplate involved in writing vulkan code. This library abstracted alot of that boiler plate away.\nOne of the biggest features of the library I was most excited about was how easy it was to output to an image rather then a window so I wouldn't \nhave to deal with windows or rendering in real time. Of course this could probably be done in cpp, but I felt like it would be a lot more work, ontop\nof trying to figure out compute shaders.\nStruggles of not really being a graphics programmer\nOne major issue I found was that I had no clue what anything did and despite extensive articles and guides, I still struggled to understand what everything\ndid. Playing around with the shader I wrote to produce the first image in the book resulted in my computer crashing many, many times.\nCurrently this project is not released on gitlab, but that shall be coming soon when I get time to work on it properly.\n","id":"https://www.effectfree.dev/blog/vulkan-raytracing/","title":"Raytracing using Vulkan"},"https://www.effectfree.dev/projects/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.effectfree.dev/projects/","title":"Projects"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.effectfree.dev/":{"body":45,"title":2},"https://www.effectfree.dev/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.effectfree.dev/blog/lockdown-code-planning/":{"body":1308,"title":7},"https://www.effectfree.dev/blog/microsoft-fanboy/":{"body":754,"title":2},"https://www.effectfree.dev/blog/vulkan-raytracing/":{"body":147,"title":3},"https://www.effectfree.dev/projects/":{"body":0,"title":1}},"length":6},"lang":"English"};
